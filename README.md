LESSON LEARNED
____________________

This project taught me that team work is valuable. I used HTML to organize and CSS to style. The game is tik tac toe, it let you know when you won.


Example:
```
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```
